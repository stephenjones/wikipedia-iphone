==History==
{{main|History of Apple Inc.}}
The company introduced the [[Apple II]] [[microcomputer]] in 1977. A few years later, in 1983, it introduced the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], the first commercial personal computer to employ a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was influenced in part by the [[Xerox Alto]]. Lisa was also the first personal computer to have the [[mouse (computing)|mouse]]. In 1984, the [[Macintosh]] was introduced, which arguably advanced the concept of a new user-friendly graphical user interface. Apple's success with the Macintosh became a major influence in the development of graphical interfaces elsewhere, with major computer [[operating system]]s, such as the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]], appearing on the market within two years of the introduction of the Macintosh.
In 1991, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] line of [[portable computer]]s. The 1990s also saw Apple's market share fall as competition from Microsoft Windows and the comparatively inexpensive [[IBM PC compatible]] computers that would eventually dominate the market. In the 2000s, Apple expanded its focus on software to include professional and [[prosumer]] video, music, and photo production solutions, with a view to promoting their products as a "digital hub". It also introduced the [[iPod]], the most popular digital music player in the world.<ref>Cantrell, Amanda.

===1976 to 1980: The early years=== 
[[Image:Apple I.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Apple I]], Apple's first product. Sold as an assembled circuit board, it lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.

The Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips) &mdash; not what is today considered a complete [[personal computer]].<ref>Kahney, Leander.

Jobs approached a local computer store, ''The Byte Shop'', which ordered fifty units and paid US$500 for each unit after much persuasion. He then ordered components from Cramer Electronics, a national electronic parts distributor. Using a variety of methods, including borrowing space from friends and family and selling various items including a [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen Type 2 bus]], Jobs managed to secure the parts needed while Wozniak and Ronald Wayne assembled the Apple I.<ref name=acmillionairemadness>{{citation|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen W.|title=Apple Confidential: The Real Story of Apple Computer, Inc.|place=San Francisco|publisher=No Starch Press|year=1999|edition=1st|url=http://www.appleconfidential.com/|pages=37-38|isbn=1-886411028-X}}</ref>
The [[Apple II series|Apple II]] was introduced on [[April 16]] [[1977]] at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because it came with color graphics and an open [[computer architecture|architecture]].  While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, this was quickly superseded by the introduction of a 5&nbsp;1/4&nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface, the [[Disk II]].
Another key to business for Apple was software. The [[Apple II]] was chosen by programmers [[Dan Bricklin]] and [[Bob Frankston]] to be the desktop platform for the first "[[killer application|killer app]]" of the business world&mdash;the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] program.<ref name=lemvc>Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/0922.html VisiCalc and the rise of the Apple II], ''Low End Mac'', [[2006-09-22]]. Retrieved on [[2007-03-02]].</ref> VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II, and the corporate market attracted many more software and hardware developers to the machine, as well as giving home users an additional reason to buy one&mdash;compatibility with the office.<ref name=lemvc/> (See the timeline for dates of [[Apple II family]] model releases&mdash;the 1977 Apple II and its younger siblings the II+, IIe, IIc, and II<small>GS</small>.)
According to Brian Bagnall's book, "On the Edge" (pg. 109-112), Apple exaggerated their sales figures and that Apple was a distant 3rd place until VisiCalc came along. VisiCalc was first released on Apple II because Commodore and Tandy computers were tied up in VisiCalc's software development office due to their popularity. VisiCalc's association with Apple was thus pure happenstance, not a technical decision. And even after VisiCalc, Apple II didn't surpass the [[TRS-80|Tandy TRS-80]], whose sales were helped by the large number of [[Radio Shack]] stores. However, VisiCalc did put Apple ahead of Commodore's PET, at least in the US. (Commodore later regained the lead for a while with the [[Commodore 64]] in the mid 80s, the best selling specific model of computer to date.)<ref>[http://www.pegasus3d.com/total_share.html Personal Computer Market Share: 1975-2004] The figures show Mac higher, but that is not a single model.</ref>
By the end of the 1970s, Jobs and his partners had a staff of computer designers and a [[production line]]. The Apple II was succeeded by the [[Apple III]] in May 1980 as the company struggled to compete against [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the lucrative business and corporate computing market. The designers of the Apple III were forced to comply with Jobs' request to omit the cooling fan, and this ultimately resulted in thousands of recalled units due to overheating.<ref>Coventry, Joshua. [http://lowendmac.com/coventry/06/0901.html Apple III Chaos: What Happened When Apple Tried to Enter the Business Market], ''Low End Mac'', [[2006-09-01]]. Retrieved on [[2007-03-02]].</ref> An updated version, the Apple III+, was introduced in 1983, but it was also a failure due to bad press and wary buyers.
In the early 1980s, IBM and Microsoft continued to gain market share at Apple's expense in the personal computer industry. A fundamentally different business model evolved, once cloners forced-open through [[reverse engineering]] the [[IBM PC]] hardware standard. In response, IBM attempted and failed to establish a new proprietary [[Micro Channel architecture]]. The IBM compatible hardware market became highly competitive, with clones running a bundled [[MS-DOS]] from a floppy disk, or running a competing [[DOS|IBM-style DOS]] such as [[DR DOS]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
Apple's sustained growth during the early 1980s was partly due to its leadership in the education sector, attributed to their adaptation of the programming language [[Logo (programming language)|LOGO]], used in many schools with the Apple II. The drive into education was accentuated in [[California]] with the donation of one Apple II and one Apple LOGO software package to each public school in the state. The deal concluded between Steve Jobs and Jim Baroux of [[LCSI]], and having required the support of [[Sacramento]], established a strong and pervasive presence for Apple in all schools throughout California. The initial conquest of education environments was critical to Apple's acceptance in the home where the earliest purchases of computers by parents was in support of children's continued learning experience.
===1981 to 1989: Lisa and Macintosh===
[[Image:Ad apple 1984.jpg|left|thumb|The rebel from Apple's [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 ad]], set in a [[dystopia]]n future modeled after the [[George Orwell|Orwell]] novel ''[[1984 (novel)|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', set the tone for the introduction of the Macintosh]]Jobs and several other Apple employees including [[Jef Raskin]] visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979 to see the [[Xerox Alto|Alto computer]]. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for selling them US$1 million in pre-[[IPO]] Apple stock (approximately US$18 million net).
It is said that Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a [[GUI]], and decided to turn over design of Apple's first project, the [[Apple Lisa]], to produce such a device. The Lisa was named after Jobs' daughter (however, an [[acronym]],<ref name=lemlisa>Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/1005.html A history of Apple's Lisa, 1979-1986], ''Low End Mac'', [[2005-10-06]].| Retrieved on [[2007-03-02]].</ref> Local Integrated Software Architecture, was coined). He was eventually pushed from the group due to infighting, and instead took over Jef Raskin's low-cost computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. Branding the new effort as the product that would "save Apple", an intense [[turf war]] broke out between the Lisa's "corporate shirts" and Jobs' Macintosh "pirates", both teams claiming they would ship first and be more successful. In 1983 the Lisa team won the race and Apple introduced the first personal computer to be sold to the public with a GUI. However, the Lisa was a commercial failure as a result of its high price tag (US$9,995) and limited software titles.<ref name=lemlisa/>
[[Image:Macintosh 128k transparency.png|thumb|200px|The [[Macintosh 128K]], the first Macintosh computer]]
In 1984, drawing upon its experience with the Lisa, Apple next launched the Macintosh. Its debut was announced by a single national broadcast of the now famous US$1.5 million television commercial, "[[1984 (television commercial)|1984]]", based on [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[1984 (novel)|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. The commercial was directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and aired during [[Super Bowl XVIII]] on [[January 22]] [[1984]]. Jobs' intention with the ad was to represent the IBM PC as [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]], and the Macintosh as a nameless female action hero portrayed by [[Anya Major]]. While the Macintosh initially sold well, follow-up sales were not particularly strong.<ref name=lem1985>Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/1002.html Good-bye Woz and Jobs: How the first Apple era ended in 1985], ''Low End Mac'', [[2006-10-02]]. Retrieved on [[2007-03-02]].</ref> The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[laser printer]] to be offered at a reasonable price point, and [[PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) package. The Mac was particularly powerful in this market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which were already necessarily built-in to create the Macintosh GUI. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the DTP market.<ref>[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm When was desktop publishing invented?] Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> As DTP became widespread, Apple's sales reached a series of new highs.
In anticipation of the Macintosh launch, [[Bill Gates]], co-founder and chairman of [[Microsoft]], was given several Macintosh prototypes in 1983 to develop software. While the company was indeed ready with its [[BASIC]] and the [[MultiPlan]] spreadsheet at the Macintosh's launch,<ref name=lem1985/> in 1985 Microsoft launched Windows, its own GUI for IBM PCs. Although sales started slow, by the mid 1990s it became the most commonly-used desktop operating system, cutting deeply into the Macintosh's sales.
An internal power struggle developed between Jobs and new CEO [[John Sculley]] in 1985.<ref name=lemsculley>Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/0222.html Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years], ''Low End Mac'', [[2006-02-22]]. Retrieved on [[2007-03-02]].</ref> Apple's [[board of directors]] sided with Sculley and Jobs was removed from his managerial duties.<ref name=lem1985/> Jobs later resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]], a computer company that built machines with futuristic designs and ran the UNIX-derived [[NeXTStep]] operating system. Although powerful, NeXT computers never caught on with buyers, due in part to their high purchase price.
===1989 to 1991: The Golden Age===
[[Image:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Macintosh Portable]] was Apple's first "portable" Macintosh computer, released in 1989.]]Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple turned to industrial designers and adopted a product strategy based in three portable devices. One portable was built by [[Sony]], which at the time had a strong reputation for designing small, durable and functional electronics devices{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. Sony took the specs of the Mac Portable, put in a smaller two-hour battery, a much smaller (physically) 20&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] [[hard disk|hard drive]] and a smaller nine-inch [[liquid crystal display|passive matrix screen]].<ref name=lempb>Hormby, Thomas.

Called the [[PowerBook 100]], this landmark product was introduced in 1991 and established the modern form and [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] layout of the [[laptop computer]].<ref name=lempb/> This solidified Apple's reputation as a quality manufacturer, both of desktop and now portable machines.<ref>[http://onlypunjab.com/fullstory2k5-insight--status-10-newsID-14130.html Apple's Powerbook laptop voted best gadget of all time!] Retrieved on [[2007-04-20]].</ref> The same year, Apple introduced a massive upgrade to the Mac OS, in the form of [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]]. Although resource-hungry (for the era), System 7 dramatically improved the Macintosh experience, adding color to the interface, simplifying common operations, and introducing a number of powerful new networking capabilities. System 7 would be the basis for the Mac OS until 2001.
The success of the PowerBook and several other Apple products during this period led to increasing revenue.<ref name=lemsculley/> The computer press listened to Apple press releases with rapt attention and speculation was rife about what projects from Apple's famed Advanced Technology Group would next come to market. Apple merely had to mention a technology, [[Taligent]] for instance, for people to christen it the "new standard".<ref name=lempink>Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/1026.html Pink: Apple's first stab at a modern operating system], ''Low End Mac'', [[2005-10-26]]. Retrieved on [[2007-03-02]].</ref> For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The [[magazine]] ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 to 1991 the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.
The continuing development of [[Microsoft Windows]] had given birth to an interface that was competitive with Apple's. Combined with a huge base of low-cost computers and peripherals and an improving software suite, an increasing number of potential customers turned to the "[[Wintel]]" standard.
Apple, relying on high profit margins to maintain their massive R&D budget, never developed a clear response. Instead they sued [[Microsoft]] for [[theft]] of [[intellectual property]], in [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation]].<ref name=lemms>Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/0825.html The Apple vs. Microsoft GUI lawsuit], ''Low End Mac'', [[2006-08-25]]. Retrieved on [[2007-03-02]].</ref> The lawsuit dragged on for years before finally being thrown out of court. Worse, the lawsuit distracted management while a deep rot developed within the engineering ranks, which became increasingly unmanageable. At first there was little outward sign of the problem, but a series of major product flops and missed deadlines destroyed Apple's reputation of invincibility.
At about the same time, Apple branched out into consumer electronics. One example of this product diversification was the [[Apple QuickTake]] digital camera, one of the first digital cameras brought to the consumer market. A more famous example was the [[Apple Newton|Newton]], [[neologism|termed]] a "[[Personal digital assistant]]" or "PDA" by Sculley, that was introduced in 1993. Though it failed commercially, it defined and launched a new category of computing and was a forerunner of devices such as [[Palm Pilot]], [[PocketPC]], and eventually the [[iPhone]].
During the 1990s, Apple greatly expanded its computer lineup. It offered a multitude of models ("[[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra 840av]]", "[[Macintosh Performa|Performa 6116]]"), but many felt Apple failed to adequately differentiate one model from another and the cost of supporting so many products adversely affected profitability. Apple lost market share to Microsoft Windows, particularly [[Windows 95]] &mdash; a major turning point in the history of the rival Windows operating system.
===1994 to 1997: Attempts at reinvention===
[[Image:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Apple Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. A financial flop, it helped pave way for the [[Palm Pilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] in the future.]]By the mid-90s, Apple realized that it had to reinvent the Macintosh in order to stay competitive in the market. The needs of both computer users and computer programs were becoming, for a variety of technical reasons, harder for the existing hardware and operating system to address.
In 1994 Apple surprised its loyalists by allying with its long-time competitor IBM and CPU maker [[Motorola]] in the so-called [[AIM alliance]]. This was a bid to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]] or PReP), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft, which had become Apple's chief competitor.
As the first step toward launching the PReP platform, Apple started the [[Power Macintosh]] line in 1994, using IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor. This processor utilized a [[RISC]] architecture, which differed substantially from the Motorola [[68k]] series that had been used by all previous Macs. Apple's OS was rewritten so that most software for the older Macs could run on the PowerPC series (in [[emulation]]).
Throughout the mid to late 1990s, Apple tried to improve its operating system's multitasking and memory management. After first attempting to modify its existing code, Apple realized that it would be better to start with an entirely new operating system and then modify it to fit the Macintosh interface. Apple did some preliminary work with IBM towards this goal with the [[Taligent]] project, but that project never produced a replacement operating system. A new internal effort, [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]], ran afoul of Apple's now uncontrollable engineering and became a massive failure. A fresh attempt was made with the [[Gershwin operating system]].
In 1995 Apple tried to break into the gaming industry with the [[Apple Pippin]]. Despite the success of competing game consoles like [[Sony PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], and [[Sega Saturn]], Pippin experienced very limited success and as little as 5000 units were sold worldwide<ref>[http://darkwatcher.psxfanatics.com/console/pippin.htm Bandai Pippin]</ref> and there was a very small variety of games available for those who did own a console. Overall this was a failure for Apple; its scope was more general in purpose than serious gaming, leaving the console expensive and underpowered compared with its rivals.
Next, the company considered its options for an [[operating system]], investigating [[Be Inc.]]'s [[BeOS]], [[NeXT]]'s [[NeXTSTEP]] OS, and also Microsoft's [[Windows NT]]. NeXTSTEP was chosen, and this supplied the platform for the modern [[Mac OS X]]. On [[February 7]] [[1997]], Apple completed its purchase of NeXT and its NeXTSTEP operating system, in the process bringing Steve Jobs back to Apple.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/*/product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1997/q2/970207.pr.rel.next.html Apple Computer, Inc.

Retrieved on [[2006-06-25]].</ref> On [[July 9]] [[1997]], [[Gil Amelio]] was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors after overseeing a 3-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO and began a critical restructuring of the company's product line.
At the 1997 [[Macworld Expo]], [[Steve Jobs]] announced that Apple would be entering into partnership with [[Microsoft]]. Settlement discussions regarding Apple's [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.|"Look and Feel" lawsuit]] and the [[San Francisco Canyon Company|QuickTime piracy lawsuit]] resulted in a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release [[Microsoft Office]] for Macintosh as well as a US$150 million investment in non-voting Apple stock. (This event is often inaccurately described as a "bailout" of Apple by Microsoft. At the time Apple had a little over US$1 billion in [[cash and cash equivalents]] according to their [[Form 10-Q|10-Q]] statement.<ref>[http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/fetchFilingFrameset.aspx?FilingID=251804&Type=HTML APPLE INC 10-Q 8/11/1997], ''[[EDGAR]]'', [[1997-08-11]]. Retrieved on [[2007-05-04]].</ref> Microsoft later sold its shares for a tidy profit.) Jobs also announced that [[Internet Explorer for Mac|Internet Explorer]] would be shipped as the default browser on the Macintosh. Microsoft chairman [[Bill Gates]] appeared at the expo on the large screen, explaining Microsoft's plans for the software they were developing for the Macintosh, and saying that he was very excited to be helping Apple. This was met with a less than positive response from the audience. Steve Jobs said:{{quote|If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple needs to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that's great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and don't do a good job, it's not somebody else's fault, it's our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we should treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we like their software.
So, the era of setting this thing up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I'm concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again.<ref>{{YouTube|id=WxOp5mBY9IY|title=Macworld Boston 1997-The Microsoft Deal}}</ref><ref>[http://www.linspire.com/linspire_letter_archives.php?id=48  Microsoft Will Help Deliver a "Better" Linux] June 14th, 2007</ref>}}
On [[November 10]] [[1997]], Apple announced a new online [[Apple Store (online)|retail store]], based upon the [[WebObjects]] application server the company had acquired in its purchase of [[NeXT]]. The new direct sales outlet was also tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy and announced at the same time as new machines using the G3 [[PowerPC]] processor.
===1998 to 2005: New beginnings===
On [[August 15]] [[1998]], Apple introduced a new all-in-one Mac computer reminiscent of the original [[Macintosh 128K]]: the [[iMac]]. The iMac design team was led by [[Jonathan Ive]], who would come later to design the [[iPod]] and the [[iPhone]].<ref name=levgrossman>Grossman, Lev.

The iMac proved phenomenally successful, selling close to 800,000 units in its first five months and significantly boosting the company's revenue and profitability. Thanks in part to the iMac; fiscal 1998 was Apple's first profitable year since 1993. Some consider the iMac an industrial design icon of the late 90s, and its designer, Jonathan Ive, has won awards for its innovation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2958950.stm Apple design guru honoured], ''[[BBC News]]'', [[2003-06-03]]. Retrieved on [[2007-05-09]].</ref>
At the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] convention, Apple purchased the Final Cut software from [[Macromedia]], beginning its entry into the [[digital video]] editing market, and signaling a return to application development after a decade long policy of delegating non-system software to its [[Claris]] subsidiary. [[iMovie]] was released in 1999 for consumers, and [[Final Cut Pro]] was released for professionals in the same year. Final Cut Pro has gone on to be a significant video-editing program. Similarly, in 2000 Apple bought [[Astarte]]'s DVDirector software, which morphed into [[iDVD]] (for consumers) and [[DVD Studio Pro]] (for professionals) at the [[Macworld Conference and Expo]] of 2001.
In 2001, Apple introduced [[Mac OS X]], the operating system based on NeXT's [[OPENSTEP]] and [[BSD]] Unix. Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X aimed to marry the stability, reliability and security of the [[Unix]] operating system with the ease of use afforded by a completely overhauled user interface. To aid users in moving their applications from [[Mac OS 9]], the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications through Mac OS X's [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic environment]]. Apple's [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] API also allowed developers to adapt their OS 9 software to use Mac OS X's features often with a simple recompile.
[[Image:Applecomputerheadquarters.jpg|left|thumb|270px|Company headquarters on [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]] in [[Cupertino]], [[California]].]]On [[May 19]] [[2001]], after much speculation, Apple announced the opening of the first official [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple Retail Stores]], to be located in major U.S. consumer locations. These stores were designed for two purposes: to stem the tide of Apple's declining share of the computer market and to counter a poor record of marketing Apple products by third-party retail outlets. The company faced challenges to balance the deployment of its own retail stores with its dependence on, and the demands of, its existing channel partners and dealers. Apple slowly built up the number of stores in the U.S., (now totaling 183 as of June 2007)<ref name=usstores/><ref>[http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/chronology.html ifo Apple Store - Apple Stores Now & In The Future] Retrieved on [[2007-06-22]].</ref> later opening stores in [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom]], recently [[Italy]], and has plans for a [[France]] location. These efforts in retail succeeded and proved to be very profitable, averaging annual returns of US$4,032 per square foot of every store, the most in retail. These returns bested retail favorites such as [[Best Buy]] at $930 and [[Tiffany's]] at $2666.
On [[October 23]] [[2001]] Apple introduced its first [[iPod]] portable [[digital audio player]] and released it on [[November 10]] of that year. The product has proven phenomenally successful; over 100 million units have been sold.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625262.stm Apple enjoys ongoing iPod demand], ''[[BBC News]]'', [[2006-01-18]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-27]].</ref> Apple's [[iTunes Store]] was introduced soon after, offering online music downloads for US 99¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The service quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 3 billion downloads by August 2007.<ref>[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/07/31itunes.html iTunes Store Tops Three Billion Songs], ''Apple Inc.'',[[2007-07-31]]. Retrieved on [[2007-08-05]].</ref>
In 2002 Apple purchased [[Nothing Real]] and their advanced digital compositing application [[Shake (software)|Shake]], raising Apple's professional commitment even higher. In the same year they also acquired [[Emagic]], and with it, obtained their professional-quality music productivity application [[Logic Pro|Logic]], which led to the development of their consumer-level [[GarageBand]] application. With [[iPhoto]]'s release in 2002, this completed Apple's collection of consumer and professional level creativity software, with the consumer-level applications being collected together into the [[iLife]] suite.
Apple's design team progressively abandoned the flashy colors of the [[iMac G3]] era in favor of white [[polycarbonate]] for consumer lines such as the [[iMac]] and [[iBook]], as well as the educational [[eMac]], and metal enclosures for the professional lines. This began with the 2001 release of the [[titanium]] PowerBook and was followed by the 2001 white iBook, the 2002 flat-panel iMac, the 2003 [[Power Mac G5]], and the 2004 Apple Cinema Displays. Divergent to this consumer/professional identity, the low-cost [[Mac mini]] has an aluminum case while featuring the distinctive white polycarbonate top.

[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/technology/06apple.html?ex=1172984400&en=d724f5ef05b0cda3&ei=5070 Apple Plans to Switch from I.B.M. to Intel Chips], ''[[New York Times]]'', [[2005-06-05]].</ref>
On [[January 10]] [[2006]], Apple released its first Intel chip computers, a new [[notebook computer]] known as the [[MacBook Pro]] (with a 15.4" screen) and a new (though cosmetically identical) iMac with purportedly two to three times faster performance compared with its predecessor. Both used Intel's [[Intel Core|Core Duo]] chip technology. Later in February, Apple introduced the new Intel-based Mac mini, running up to four times faster and also featuring [[Front Row]], available with a Core Duo or Core Solo (single core) processor. In February 2006, the Apple Online Store sold its last 17" iMac G5, Apple ended the life of its 15" PowerBook G4 on [[February 22]] [[2006]], and the G4 Mac mini was removed from the Apple online store on [[February 28]] [[2006]] and replaced with the Intel Core Mac mini. On [[March 10]] [[2006]] Apple retired the iMac G5 and on [[May 16]] [[2006]], replaced the [[iBook|iBook G4]] and the 12" [[PowerBook G4]] with the [[MacBook]]. On [[August 7]] [[2006]], the PowerMac was replaced with the [[Mac Pro]], completing the transition of all Mac computers, well in advance of their original prediction. On [[September 6]] [[2006]], Apple updated its iMac line to include new [[Intel Core 2 Duo]] processors, and adding a model with a 24" screen to the line-up, as well as quietly bumping the speeds of their [[Mac mini]]. The [[Xserve]] was transitioned in mid-November 2006. On [[October 24]] [[2006]] the MacBook Pros were fitted with Intel Core 2 Duo processors as well, running up to 39% faster than the original Intel Core Duo MacBook Pros. The MacBooks were fitted with the Core 2 Duo processors on [[November 8]], and run up to 25% faster than the Core Duo ones according to Apple's tests.<ref>[http://www.apple.com/macbook/intel.html Apple – Macbook – Intel Core 2 Duo], ''Apple Inc.''. Retrieved on [[2007-05-09]].</ref>
Apple's current operating system, [[Mac OS X v10.4]] "Tiger", runs natively on the new Intel machines, as do the [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] [[open source]] underpinnings. Many applications, such as iLife '06, also run natively on Intel chips. Other applications (including Microsoft Office) which have not been updated to run on the Intel architecture, run using a technology known as [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]. Because Rosetta is a translation software that allows PowerPC programs to run on Intel processors, these PowerPC programs run slower than native applications. Programs compiled only for the PowerPC must be recompiled to run at full speed on the new Intel machines. Programs that have been designed to run on both PowerPC and Intel chips can be certified by Apple as "Universal".<ref>[http://developer.apple.com/softwarelicensing/agreements/maclogo.html Software Licensing Agreements: Mac Logo Program], ''Apple Inc.''. Retrieved on [[2006-10-22]].</ref> The Intel-based machines also do not support Classic, which allows Mac OS X to run applications written for OS 9 and earlier, so applications that require this environment will not run on these machines. Apple currently has no plans to bring Classic support to the Intel platform.
The Intel chip also allows the new machines to run the Windows operating system. On [[March 16]] [[2006]] a bootloader CD image and a how-to for getting XP on your MacBook Pro, iMac, or mini was released to the Internet as an entry into a US$13,000 contest. Many hackers attempted over three months to win the prize by becoming the first to run Windows natively on a new Intel Mac. The Intel-based Macs are now the only computers officially capable of running both Mac OS X and Windows without emulation (a pre-release version of Mac OS X for Intel was patched to run on non-Apple PCs through the [[OSx86]] community; however such procedure is not permitted by the Apple [[EULA]]). Further, on [[April 5]] [[2006]], Apple announced a new piece of software called [[Boot Camp]] that helps users install Windows XP on their Intel Mac alongside Mac OS X. Apple has said that Boot Camp will be included, as standard, in Apple's next OS release ([[Mac OS X v10.5|10.5, “Leopard”]]).
[[Image:Imac17pouces.png|left|thumb|The first Intel-based Macintosh desktop: The [[iMac]]]]The Apple/Intel partnership coined several [[catch phrase]]s among Apple fans and technology reporters. Some of the most widespread ones include "Mactel" and "Macintel", a response to the phrase "[[Wintel]]", which is an informal [[moniker]] that describes all Intel-powered systems running the Microsoft Windows operating system. Another is "ICBM", for "Intel-chip-based Mac." Apple itself has not publicly used these terms.

[[Image:Apple-iPhone.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[iPhone]] is Apple's [[multi-touch]] [[smartphone]], released on [[June 29]] [[2007]] for [[AT&T Mobility]].]]Apple introduced the Apple Macintosh family in 1984 and today makes consumer, professional, and educational computers. The Mac mini is the company's consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in January 2005 and designed to motivate Windows users to switch to the Mac computer platform.  The [[iMac]] is a consumer desktop computer that was first introduced by Apple in 1998, and its popularity helped save the company. The iMac is similar in concept to the original Macintosh in that the monitor and computer are housed in a single unit. It is now in its third major design iteration, and has been upgraded many times (including a switch to Intel processors) using the same design. The Power Mac brand was replaced in 2006 with the [[Mac Pro]], featuring two 64-bit [[multi-core (computing)|dual-core]] [[Xeon]] "Woodcrest" processors, available in speeds of 2, 2.66, and 3&nbsp;[[GHz]]. The Mac Pro is capable of supporting up to four 750&nbsp;GB hard drives for a total of 3&nbsp;[[terabytes|TB]] of internal hard disk space and has 8 [[DIMM]] slots for up to 16&nbsp;GB of [[random access memory|RAM]]. On its promotional website, Apple says that the "Mac Pro not only completes the Mac transition to Intel processors but delivers advanced performance, workstation graphics, and up to 4.9 million possible configurations." Apple's server range includes the [[Xserve]], a dual core, dual processor 1U server, and the [[Xserve RAID]] for server storage options.
Apple introduced the [[iBook]] consumer portable computer as a companion to the iMac; it is Apple's lowest-cost portable computer. The iBook brand was replaced on [[May 16]] [[2006]] with the [[MacBook]] featuring the Intel Core Duo processor, 13&nbsp;inch widescreen, and available black color on the high-end model. The MacBook Pro is the professional portable computer alternative to the MacBook. The MacBook Pro is marketed as being intended for professional and creative users and replaced the PowerBook models, which were introduced in 1991.
On [[October 23]] [[2001]], Apple introduced the [[iPod]] digital music player. Initially equipped with a 5 GB hard drive and a monochrome screen, models today can store up to 160 GB and display video, play games, and support a wide range of third-party add-on devices. As of September 2007, Apple currently sells the [[iPod shuffle]]. [[iPod nano]], [[iPod classic]] and [[iPod touch]], as well as the [[iPhone]] which includes iPod functionality.<ref>Apple, Inc.

At the [[Macworld Conference & Expo]] in January 2007, Steve Jobs revealed the long anticipated [[iPhone]], a convergence of an Internet-enabled [[smartphone]] and video iPod. The iPhone combines a 2.5G [[quad band]] [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] cellular phone with features found in hand held devices, running a scaled-down versions of Apple's Mac OS X, with various applications such as [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] [[web browser]], e-mail, and [[Google Maps|navigation]]. The iPhone features a 3.5&nbsp;inch touch screen display, [[Bluetooth]], [[WiFi]] (both "b" and "g"), and comes in 4 and 8&nbsp;GB models. The iPhone first became available on [[June 29]] [[2007]].
Additionally at the conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]], (previously known as the iTV), a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via WiFi or a wired network, with one computer's [[iTunes]] library and streams from an additional four. The Apple TV incorporates a 40&nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, includes outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and plays video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]]. It was later updated to include a 160&nbsp;GB drive for even more space for media.
Apple sells a variety of computer accessories for Mac computers including the [[AirPort]] wireless networking products, [[Apple Cinema Display|Apple Cinema HD Display]] and [[Apple Displays]] computer displays, [[Apple Mighty Mouse|Mighty Mouse]] and [[Apple Wireless Mouse]] computer mice, the [[Apple Wireless Keyboard]] computer keyboard, and the [[Apple USB Modem]].

Since 2004, [[Greenpeace]] has attacked Apple for not setting a timeline to remove [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[Brominated flame retardant|BFRs]], which still exist in recent products such as the [[iPod nano]] and [[MacBook]]; and for not promoting a global end-of-life take back plan for Apple hardware (although it does within [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] where this is required by law); as well as for not having reusable components.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/itox.html iTox + iWaste], ''A greener Apple''.

[[Image:Leopard_9A559_Desktop.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Mac OS X]] "[[Mac OS X v10.5|Leopard]]" is the upcoming version of one of Apple's major software products.]]
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[Mac OS X]]. Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its Mac OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package which bundles [[iDVD]], [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]], [[iTunes]], [[GarageBand]], and [[iWeb]]. For presentation and page layout, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]], [[Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] [[web browser]] are available as free downloads for both Mac OS X and Windows.

==Corporate affairs==
Critics of Apple commonly point to their [[vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] business model, where all the hardware and operating system software comes from one company. Although the Apple II was very open, the Macintosh was originally closed and proprietary, and during the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating and implementing their own (for example, [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] and [[NuBus]]).
This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since adopted [[USB]], [[AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of such standards. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard which has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]].
However, the iPod remains a mostly closed and vertically-integrated platform. Although Apple provides documented interfaces for hardware accessories, developers have no supported way to add features to the software (such as decoding of additional formats). Although the iPod supports the mainstream [[MP3]] and [[advanced audio coding|AAC]] formats, there is not support for other proprietary formats, like [[Windows Media Audio|Windows Media]] (this can be converted to AAC with iTunes on Windows), [[RealAudio]] and the open [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]] format. Apple has refused to license its [[FairPlay]] [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] system to other online music vendors.<ref name=NewsMax/> The company added Windows PC support with their second generation iPod series.
Ever since the first Apple store opened, Apple has wanted third parties to sell their products and software inside their stores. This allows, for instance, Nikon and Canon to sell their Mac-compatible digital cameras and camcorders inside the store. Adobe, the largest Apple software partner, also sells its Mac-compatible software, as does Microsoft, who sells Microsoft Office for the Mac. A notable exception are books published by [[John Wiley & Sons]].

===Advertising===
{{main|Apple Inc. advertising}}
Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl commercial]] to the more modern '[[Get a Mac]]' adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products, though it has been [[Apple Inc. advertising#Criticism|criticized]] for the content of more recent campaigns.
====Logos====
[[Image:Apple first logo.png|147px|thumb|right|The original Apple logo featuring [[Isaac Newton]] under the fabled apple tree.]][[Image:Apple Computer Logo.svg|147px|thumb|right|The rainbow Apple logo, used from late 1976 to early 1999.]][[Image:Apple-logo.png|thumb|The white Apple logo, used from 1999 to present]]
:''See also: [[U+F8FF]] or ''[[|<span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, monotype"></span>]]'', seen as the Apple logo in [[Typography of Apple Inc.|some fonts]].''
Apple’s first logo, designed by Jobs and Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]’s “rainbow Apple,” the now-familiar [[rainbow]]-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it, possibly as a tribute to [[Isaac Newton]]'s discoveries of the gravity (the apple), and the separation of light by prisms (the colors). This was one of several designs Janoff presented to Jobs in 1976.<ref>[http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,60597,00.html Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion]</ref>
While it is generally accepted to have been in reference to Isaac Newton, some believe that the bitten apple is a [[homage]] to the mathematician [[Alan Turing]], on whose deathbed an apple laced with cyanide was found. Turing, one of whose favorite films was Disney's [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]], is regarded as one of the fathers of the computer.<ref>[http://www.greggore.com/dln021203.htm]</ref>
In 1999, Apple began enforcing the use of a strictly [[monochrome]] logo—supposedly at the insistence of a newly re-inaugurated Jobs—nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation. However, no specific color is prescribed; for example, it is grey on the Power Mac G5, Mac Mini, and iMac, black on the Aluminum iMac, blue (by default) in Mac OS X, chrome on the 'About this Mac' panel and the boot screen in Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4, red on many software packages, and white on the iBook, PowerBook G4, PowerBook G3 (late models), MacBook, and MacBook Pro. The logo's shape is one of the most recognized brand symbols in the world, identifies all Apple products and retail stores (the name "Apple" is usually not even present), and notably included as [[label|stickers]] in nearly all Macintosh and iPod packages through the years.
====Slogans====
{{main|List of Apple Inc. slogans}}
Apple's first slogan, "[[Byte]] into an Apple", was coined in the late 1970s. Once Apple started selling more than just computers, slogans were created for each individual product, rather than for the company itself. For example, the slogan "iThink, therefore iMac", was used in 1998 to promote the iMac. Several company-directed slogans are marketed today; however Apple tends to focus mainly on marketing its products individually.
===Litigation===
{{main|Notable litigation of Apple Inc.}}
Apple's earliest court action dates to 1978 when [[Apple Records]], [[The Beatles]]-founded record label, [[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer|filed suit against Apple Computer]] for [[trademark]] infringement. The suit settled in 1981 with an amount of US$80,000 being paid to [[Apple Corps]]. As a condition of the settlement, Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business. The case arose in 1989 again when Apple Corps sued over the Apple II<small>GS</small>, which included a professional synthesizer chip, claiming violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991 another settlement of around US$26.5 million was reached.<ref>[http://news.com.com/Apple+vs.+Apple+Perfect+harmony/2100-1027_3-5378401.html news.com: Apple vs. Apple: Perfect harmony?]</ref> In September 2003 Apple Computer was sued by Apple Corps again, this time for introducing the iTunes Music Store and the iPod, which Apple Corps believed was a violation of the previous agreement by Apple Computer not to distribute music.<ref>[http://www.legalzoom.com/articles/article_content/article11325.html legalzoom.com: Apple v Apple: What is at the core of The Beatles’ Apple Records vs. Apple Ipod…]</ref> The trial in the UK ended on [[May 8]] [[2006]] with victory for Apple Computer. The judge ruled the company's iTunes Music Store did not infringe on the trademark of Apple Corps and ordered Apple Corps to pay the legal costs.<ref>''[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j4226/apple_v_apple_hc03c02428_0506.htm Apple Corps Ltd. v. Apple Computer, Inc.]'', [[Royal Courts of Justice]]</ref> A new settlement was announced on [[February 5]] [[2007]] giving Apple, Inc. control over the Apple mark with Apple Corps licensed to use it. Portions of the settlement are confidential, but each side will pay its own legal costs. As the Beatles' songs are not available for download from any legal music download sites, including the iTunes Music Store, Jobs' highly public nod to the Beatles (playing "[[Lovely Rita]]" on the iPhone) during his [[January 9]] [[2007]] Macworld keynote fueled widespread speculation about a deal to sell Beatles songs on iTunes. A spokewoman for Apple Corps said the settlement had no bearing on any such matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/business/06apple.html|title=2 Apples End a Long-Running Trademark Fight|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[2007-02-06]]|last=Pfanner|first=Eric|accessdate=2007-02-05}}</ref>
Of the matter, Steve Jobs said "We love the Beatles, and it has been painful being at odds with them over these trademarks. It feels great to resolve this in a positive manner, and in a way that should remove the potential of further disagreements in the future."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,250291,00.html|title=Steve Jobs' Apple Inc. Wins Control of 'Apple' Brand From Beatles' Apple Corps|work=[[FoxNews]]|date=[[2007-02-06]]|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>
In a more recent previously unrelated lawsuit, Apple entered into a [[class action]] settlement,<ref>http://www.appleipodsettlement.com</ref> upheld on [[December 20]] [[2005]] following an appeal, regarding the battery life of [[iPod]] music players sold prior to May 2004. Eligible members of the class are entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement.
[[Creative Technology|Creative]] also recently filed a patent dispute alleging that Apple infringed on one of Creative's patents for their [[Creative Zen|Zen]] player with the iPod and iPod nano.<ref>http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1743</ref> On [[August 23]] [[2006]], Apple and Creative settled their patent disputes by paying [[Creative Technology|Creative]] US$100 million.
On [[January 10]] [[2007]], [[Cisco]] sued Apple for the iPhone, since Cisco has held the trademark on the name "iPhone" since 2000. Cisco had refused rights to use the name "iPhone" on multiple occasions. Apple and Cisco had been in talks for a while about use of the name, though Apple had been denied the use of the name on several occasions leading up through [[January 9]]. Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company to attempt to acquire the name through other means, but failed also. During the 2007 Macworld Expo, Apple used Cisco's "iPhone" name anyway.<ref>[http://news.com.com/2100-1047-6149285.html?tag=yt "Cisco sues Apple over use of iPhone trademark"], ''[[CNET]]'', [[2007-01-10]].</ref> On [[February 22]] [[2007]] Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSWEN460920070222 "Cisco and Apple can both use iPhone name"], ''[[Reuters]]'', [[2007-02-22]].</ref>
In July 2007, Colorado-based photographer Louis Psihoyos filed suit against Apple for allegedly ripping his "wall of videos" imagery to advertise for Apple TV. According to Psihoyos, Apple had been negotiating with Psihoyos for rights to the imagery, but backed out and promptly used the imagery anyway. <ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/04/apple-facing-two-lawsuits-for-alleged-copyright-violations/ Apple Faces Two Lawsuits for Alleged Copyright Violations], ''[[Engadget]]''.</ref>
====Stock option backdating investigation====
On [[June 29]] [[2006]], Apple announced that an internal investigation "discovered irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001."<ref>[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jun/29stock.html Apple to Investigate Stock Option Grants], ''Apple Inc.'', [[2006-06-29]]. Retrieved on [[2007-05-08]].</ref> A Special Committee reported the findings of the stock backdating investigation three months later on [[October 4]] [[2006]], stating "the investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current management team", … "the most recent evidence of irregularities relates to a January 2002 grant", and "stock option grants made on 15 dates between 1997 and 2002 appear to have grant dates that precede the approval of those grants". The Special Committee also reported that "in a few instances, Apple CEO Steve Jobs was aware that favorable grant dates had been selected, but he did not receive or otherwise benefit from these grants and was unaware of the accounting implications."<ref>[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/oct/04investigation.html Apple’s Special Committee Reports Findings of Stock Option Investigation], ''Apple Inc.'', [[2006-10-04]]. Retrieved on [[2007-05-08]].</ref> Documents were subsequently faked to indicate a special board meeting had occurred and that the options had been granted on that day.<ref>Mintz, Howard; Wolverton, Troy.

Retrieved on [[2007-05-08]].</ref>
On [[April 24]] [[2007]], the SEC announced it had filed charges against former Apple chief financial officer [[Fred D. Anderson]] and former Apple general counsel [[Nancy R. Heinen]] for their alleged roles in backdating Apple options.<ref name=options>[http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2007/2007-70.htm SEC Charges Former Apple General Counsel for Illegal Stock Option Backdating], ''[[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]]'', [[2007-04-24]].

In late April 2007, the SEC announced that it would not bring action against Apple due to its "swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation." Most analysts took this statement to mean that Apple was in the clear, and Steve Jobs personally read the statement to concerned shareholders at a meeting.
===Culture===
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a corporate culture should look like in terms of organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, et cetera). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same time period include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Microsoft]], and the relative success of these firms (whether a result of their cultural differences or not) resulted in the widespread adoption of informal corporate culture within the technology industry.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like IBM more or less by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (television commercial)|"1984" TV ad]], this trait had become a key way the company differentiated itself from its competitors.<ref>[[ValueWiki:AAPL#Corporate Culture|Apple Corporate Culture]]</ref>
====Apple Fellows====
As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ, especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program. Apple Fellows are those who have made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],<ref name=hertzfeld>[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

==Users==
According to surveys by [[J. D. Power]], Apple has the highest brand and repurchase loyalty of any computer manufacturer. While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, Apple appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. Apple evangelist [[Guy Kawasaki]] has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon".<ref>Huba, Jackie; McConnell, Ben. [http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp The father of evangelism marketing].</ref> Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of [[user group|Mac User Groups]] in most major and many minor centers of population where Mac computers are available.
